Transform this block-out into: ${description}.

Make sure to add NO new objects: Only objects should be ones outlined in ${objectSource}.

Make sure all ground and terrain stays absolutely flat, no bumps or hills or mounds.

The blocks are rough massing stand-ins, not final shapes: resolve each one into the naturally-shaped thing it represents — buildings get pitched roofs, eaves and overhangs; creatures and machines get their organic or mechanical silhouettes — so nothing still reads as a plain box; keep each footprint and size.${styleReference}

Same camera, same composition, same proportions — every block becomes the full-sized real thing it stands for, exactly in place, and painted ground colors become the terrain features they mark. Crisp realistic materials with visible construction detail. Never a miniature, toy, or diorama. Pure black background: every pixel outside the terrain chunk stays flat #000000.`
